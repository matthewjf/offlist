    title: 'Toilet Box - Terrify Children on Christmas',
    description: "Just installed a new toilet, big sturdy box left. Would be great for moving, but better to put your child's Christmas present inside.

Imagine the excitement building with such a huge gift waiting under the tree, only to see it dashed when they rip off the paper and a photo of a potty is on the front.

'We got you a new potty!' you'll exclaim.

Watch their crestfallen face as they try to figure out if this is a trick.

Carry on as long as you like until actually opening the box and revealing their real present. You can't buy memories and trauma like that.

Box measures 32x27x17. First come first served. I'll attempt to take the ad down as soon as the box is gone, but I'm busy thinking up ways to terrorize my own kids.

Merry Christmas!",

    title: '6 top ramen chicken flavor packets',
    description: "I recently finished a 6 pack of Top Ramen Chicken Flavor noodles that someone gave me. I don't eat meat, so I just made vegetarian stock and cooked the noodles in that. I didn't want to throw the flavor packets away because what if someone out there (someone like you!) really loves the Chicken Flavor packets and has always wished for some extra that they didn't have to use to flavor their noodles. . .

TODAY IS YOUR DAY

You can nab these Chicken Flavor packets and use them to flavor popcorn, different noodles, marinade, etc. Maybe you just want extra flavor in your Top Ramen Chicken Flavor noodles! Or maybe you want to mix the Chicken Flavor with the Beef Flavor or the Shrimp Flavor! I even know some folks who used Flavor Packets like these to create a more intense obstacle course by filling kiddie pools with Ramen Water (maybe wait till Spring to try out this idea though(oh man, Chicken Flavor Snow Balls!!))! These are 6 extra Chicken Flavor packets of possibilities! ",

Don't laugh, there's a lot of idiots out here, like me, who can't wait to spend my meager finances on something guaranteed to make me a star overnight.

Big bucks, big hype and big remorse.
That star thing?
Not quite yet.

I fell hard for the acoustic 'king-of-hype,' the self-proclaimed 'six-string diety' .......the legendary Esteban.

The shades, the jingly bling, the gravelly voice, the smoove and the swank. What can I say? I'm a foo' fo' croonin' geezers.

I poured butt-load of shekels into this piece of crap, and am figuring there's gotta be someone more torpid than me out there.

Nary a pence less.",
